# Haskell Parser: A deep dive into Parsec

This repo consists of multiple steps each adding another feature from Parsec.
Each step adds the following thing
- [step-1](/step-1): basic structure
- [step-2](/step-2): error handling with different error messages
- [step-3](/step-3): current possition in the input
- [step-4](/step-4): more abstraction by adding a Stream class
- [step-5](/step-5): a bunch of combinaters from Parsec

Everything is well documented and theres even [a example of how to build a json parser](/json-example).
